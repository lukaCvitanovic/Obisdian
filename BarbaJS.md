- Small library that helps make smooth and fliud animations between web pages
- **Not compatible with React or Vue**

## Markup
- Uses HTML attributes to figure out page structure
	- **Wrapper**
		- Main section
			- Inside the wrapper and outside the container **does not change**
	- **Container**
		- Content is updated automaticly between pages
	- Namespaces allowe **unique names for each page**

## Transitions
- Made of **leave** and **enter** animation
- Animations are handeled by third-party library
	- Works well with [[GSAP]]


## Custom Code
- Custom code for updating components (navigation elements) on page change
	- Place custom code under the views and put a specific namespace
		- beforeEnter
		- afterEnter

## Lifecycle
- Barba makes the site work like SPA so no reloading between page changes
- **Default behaviour**:
	- prefetch the next page
	- store it in catche
	- add the `data-barba="container"` of the next page to the end of `data-barba="wrapper"` element
	- remove current `data-barba="container"` from DOM after the transition
- During the transition styles to the container are applyed by animation library
	- Done by us
	- **Where the magic happens**

## [Hooks](https://barba.js.org/docs/advanced/hooks/)
- Triggered by transitions and views
- Not shared between them
	- Run separately

## [Transitions](https://barba.js.org/docs/advanced/transitions/)
- Transitions are applied based on rules
- Made of **keyworkds** and **conditions**
	- Keywords define the logic to folow when applying the transition
		- **From** and **To**
		- They have set of conditions
	- **Priopirty**:
		1) from **AND** to
		2) to
		3) from
	- Conditions can be namespaces, routes or custom functions
		- **Priority**:
			1) Custom function when true
			2) route when current.route.name matches
			3) namespace when current.namespace matches
- Transition resolution
	- Selecting of a transition
	- **Priority**:
		1) Condition priority
		2) Keyword priority
		3) Declaration order
- Transitions to the same page are done with **self** namespace

## Strategies
- **Cache**
	- Barba performs page caching so the the visidet pages are ready
		- Default behaviour
- **Prefetch**
	- Prefetches the page on the **mouseover** or **touchstart** events
		- Usually the 100-300ms is enough to load a page
		- Default behaviour
- **Prevent**
	- Prevents the users from eligable links during the transitions

## Recepies
- **Manage Containers**
	- Since Barba keeps bouth containers inside the wrapper during the transition sometimes it is usefull to remove the current container for thatever reason
		- Default: Barba removes the container at the end of transition
		- Manualy remove current container with `data.current.container.remove()`
		- Set `position: absolute` to keep the containers superpositioned
- **Scroll Position**
	- Since the Barba doesn't do the page reload, or browser tab reload, after the transition the **scroll position will need to be reloaded**
		- Can be easily done with global hooks
	- Backward/forward buttons also **restore scroll position**
		- Default browser behaviour
		- To disable it set the scroll restoration to maual `history.scrollRestoration = "manual"`
			- Some third-party libs like LocomotiveScroll do this by default
		- To restore scroll position while scrollRestoration is enabled use x/y scroll position with Barba history object: `barba.history.current.scroll.x`
