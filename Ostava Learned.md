## Description[[Workshop Learned#Wood work|**]]
- When measuring, make sure that the measurement will be valid for the whole length of the work
- To prevent planks from cracking when driving a screw in them is to either put a little WD40 on the screw or buy a larger plank, for this example a 4X4 would have worked fine
	- Although the screws for the wall fastening would need to be larger
- It is possible to use a wrench for screwing if the appropriate wrench head is placed that can fit drill screw bit
	- Useful for extra leverage
