- All invoices updated in [[Classic]]
- Over the weekend [56615](https://one.newrelic.com/logger?account=1747307&duration=259200000&state=52b5a17b-35c0-c61b-155a-c26e6d4e72e7) invoices have been processed
- Positive anomalous behaviour
	- System managed to process quite large amount of invoices
		- There were errors but things still got processed
			- Errors included delete failures and `SignatureDoesNotMatch: Signature expired`
				- Errors were seen on `receiveMessagae` and `sendMessage`
					- **Possible Explanation** is that `correctClockSkew` worked on second try the message was processed
						- There is a small probability that this explanation is correct
	- **Possible Explanation** for what this run was successful
		- Run was performed when there was no other traffic on the service, thus no interruptions
			- No interruptions in a sense that Bottleneck didn't have any `ON_DEMAND` processes, only `BULK` ones, hence those were not being throttled
		- The change to check the queue status may have caused service to be awakened every 5 min
