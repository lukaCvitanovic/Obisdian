With testing we are trying to:
- Check logical validity of the given functionality of the code
	- Test wheter the code does what it's supose to do
- Find bugs that were missed during the development
	- By testing the code for different situations and circumstances
- The scope of the tested code could vary
	- hence the different testing sizes
