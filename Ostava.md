## Description
- Build a pantry using cut up doors
	- Dimensions 85x70 (wXd)
		- The shelves needed additional cutting b/c the wall is not the same width for the whole length of the shelf
		- [ ] For this reason there is a gap between shelves the right wall which should be filled in somehow
	- Spacing of the shelves (from the top):
		- 45 to the roof
		- 40 between shelves
		- 90 from the floor to the top of the first shelf
	- For fastening small planks (dim: 2X4) were used for holding the door sections
		- Planks were fastened to the wall using a plug for Siporex on the left wall and concrete Fischer plug for the right wall
	- [ ] Put glooing foil on the shelves to prevent the shelves from being ruined if sonething spils
		- The foil is 45 wide so it would take 2 of them to cover the shelf
		- The fron side of the sheves also need to be covered

## Warnings
- The nearest screw hole on the left wall is close to where the wire for the vent and the heater in the WC is in the wall
- Some of the planks cracked when the shelves were screwed to the planks
